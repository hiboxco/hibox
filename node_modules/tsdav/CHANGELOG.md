## v2.0.0-rc.1

**improvements**

- fixed wrong namespace issue

## v2.0.0-rc.0

**breaking**

- removed `DAVFilter` and `DAVProp`, now all function uses `ElementCompact` as prop and filter directly generated from `xml-js` instead.
- removed related `formatProp`, `formatFilter` and `mergeObjectDupKeyArray` function since they are not needed (These functions were marked as internal so they really shouldn't be causing breaking change).
- removed `DAVNamespaceShorthandMap` and added `DAVNamespaceShort` as a replacement.
- renamed parameter `vCardUrlFilter` of function `fetchVCards` to `urlFilter` for consistent naming.
- collectionQuery now accepts `DAVNamespaceShort` instead of `DAVNamespace`.

**features**

- added `freeBusyQuery` for CALDAV, note this feature is not working with many caldav providers.
- added `expand` for `fetchCalendarObjects` so it can now.
- added `prop` and `filter` overriding feature to functions where overriding is possible.

**improvements**

- now fetchCalendar fetch `calendarColor` by default.

**docs**

- added a helper to convert `xml` between tsdav compatible `js` objects.
- added migration helper to help convert old `DAVProp` and `DAVFilter` into new `ElementCompact`.
- fixed theming issues to create a more consistent light theme.
- added sitemap for docs for better seo.
- archived version 1.x docs.

## v1.1.0

**breaking changes**

- `DAVClient` is no longer a type returned by `createDAVClient`, instead it's a class that can be instantiated.
- `timeRange` in `fetchCalendarObjects` is now validated against `ISO_8601` standard and invalid format will throw an error.
- typescript target changed to `es2015`, if you are on `node >= 10` and `browsers that are not IE and have been updated since 2015`, you should be fine. support for `es5` output is not possible with added `esm` support.

**features**

- added a new way to create `DAVClient` by `new DAVClient(...params)`.
- added support for `esm`.
