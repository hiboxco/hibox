		<div class="articleContent"><h2>I. TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h2>
<h3>1. GENERAL TERMS</h3>
<p>1.1. The user (hereafter “Client” or “User”) and <strong>Hibox</strong> (hereafter the “Developer”) agree to the following terms and conditions. These conditions are considered accepted whenever the User signs up for an account on Hibox (hereafter the “Application”) or visits any website owned by the Developer.</p>
<h3>2. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS</h3>
<p>2.1. The Developer hereby declares to possess the rights, licenses and pertinent authorizations to the necessary tools for the development and implementation of the Platform. The intellectual property of all development will be exclusively the property of the developer.</p>
<p>2.2. The Developer grants to the Client a non-transferable, non-sub-licensable, non- exclusive, temporary, territorially limited and onerous license for the use of the Platform and all modifications and adaptations made. The license is restrictive and does not include the power to exploit the Platform or use the Platform for anything other than the situations defined in these Terms and Conditions. The license of use implies both the possibility of using the application by the members, contractors, employees, users, of the client, as well as the possibility of inviting users to participate in the same application. In any case the user must accept the Terms of Use for which the developer will grant each user a limited license of use.</p>
<p>2.3. All text, graphics, user interface, visual interface, photograph, brand, logo, sound, music, illustration, content and programming code, whether source or object included, among other aspects, design, structure, expression, “aspect and appearance” and the disposal of such content on the platform, is exclusive property of the Developer or licensed by the Developer, and is protected by copyright, patent, trademark, and international intellectual property treaties.</p>
<h3>3. CONFIDENTIALITY</h3>
<p>3.1. For the effects of these Terms and Conditions, the Parties understand by “Confidential Information” the non-public information that the Developer identifies as confidential or that in the event of being revealed, should be treated as confidential. Confidential Information includes, without limit to, information related to the Developer’s software or hardware products, irrespective of whether they have been released for sale, offered in the market or promoted in any way; the practices or commercial policies of the Developer; its technical and financial knowledge; source and object codes; plans for future products; commercialization plans; specifications; formulas; settings for teams and networks; business strategy; inventions; discoveries; improvements; industrial secrets; interfaces; graphic designs; GUI; client data; users and employees; general “know-how”; drawings and models; algorithms; pricing information; ideas and any other information belonging to or in possession of the Developer, whether supplied by the Client or any other manner. For the effects of these Terms and Conditions, all the information that is provided to the Client or that the Client becomes aware of during the use and implementation of the Platform for the Client, whether the information belongs to the Developer or a Third Party, will be considered Confidential Information, without any need to indicate it as such.</p>
<p>3.2. Notwithstanding the above, the following will not be considered Confidential Information: information that (i) is or becomes public and available in such a way that it does not constitute a violation by the Client of any obligation to the Developer; (ii) or that was known by the Client before the Developer made the Client aware of said information; (iii) or that the Client became aware of by a different source than the Developer and that would not represent a violation of any confidentiality obligation to the Developer or (iv) that has been developed independently by the Client.</p>
<p>3.3. The Client declares to know that the Confidential Information is private and its disclosure would cause irreparable damage to the Developer, its partners or clients. As such, the Client will not reveal any Confidential Information to third parties, under any circumstance, without previous written authorization from the Developer.</p>
<p>3.4. The Client is expressly obligated to take all the necessary measures to protect, under the strictest confidentiality, all the Confidential Information that they are supplied with, and must take measures that as at least as effective as the measures they take to protect their own Confidential Information. In particular, the Client must protect the Confidential Information from illicit acts by third parties, such as thievery or spying. If by a judicial order the Client is obligated to share all or part of the Confidential Information, the Client will be able to comply with this requirement having previously notified the Developer within twenty four (24) hours of receiving the judicial notification in the interest of the Client proceeding to take the actions that are necessary to protect their interests.</p>
<p>3.5. The obligations of confidentiality and the use of confidential information contained in these Terms and Conditions have an indefinite validity.</p>
<p>3.6. The Parties recognize that the Developer will suffer an irreparable damage as a consequence of the violation of the obligations contemplated here, and as such any breach by the Client of the assumed obligations in these Terms and Conditions will enable the Developer to take the necessary legal actions to reclaim the losses and damages that the Client inflicted or could inflict, including all Lawyer’s fees and costs incurred by the Developer.</p>
<p>3.7. The Developer will be able to use the implementation of the Platform by the Client for marketing uses, such as case studies, provided that it is for lawful purposes and that in no case the image and prestige of the Client is affected.</p>
<h3>4. GENERAL CONDITIONS</h3>
